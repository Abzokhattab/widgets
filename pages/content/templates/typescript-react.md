## TypeScript React template

This template includes the basic configuration for the TypeScript React widget implementation.

## Prerequisites

Please refer to the [installation guide](/getting-started/0-installation) to see what software is necessary to run this project.

Also see the [TypeScript configuration section](/getting-started/2-typescript-configuration) to make sure you have all the tools installed.

## Get started

To start developing:

1. Open a terminal session in the folder
2. Run `npm install`, to install the dependencies

If you encounter any error during the installation process connected to the `@tecnojest/widget-base` package, you may need to build the `lib` yourself. See [building the lib yourself](../getting-started/installation#building-the-lib-yourself) for the guide on how to do it.

When everything is complete, you are ready to develop!
