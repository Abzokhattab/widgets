## Introduction

Here you can find the instructions on how to use the `EmbeddableWidget` API.  
It is accessible in two ways described below.

## EmbeddableWidget Engine API

This way is usually used while developing the widget, typically in the `index` file of your widget project. There you can define very general settings for the widget.

## Window API

Through the global `window` API you can access widget-specific options and methods. This will help you to modify the widget's state or look at runtime.
