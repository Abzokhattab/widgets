## Contributing to the codebase

Feel free to contribute to any part of the codebase. The process should look like so:

1. Identify a bug or an issue
2. Check if the issue has been found already
3. If not, thoroughly describe it in a GitLab Issue in [our repository](https://gitlab.com/energenious/widgets/-/issues)
4. Create a Pull/Merge Request with the solution
5. Await approval or input from maintainers

## CI/CD configuration

Please run the CI/CD locally using GitLab Runner. The guide on how to use it can be found here: [GitLab Runner Installation and Usage](https://medium.com/@umutuluer/how-to-test-gitlab-ci-locally-f9e6cef4f054)
