# JavaScript React template

This template includes the basic configuration for the JavaScript React widget implementation.

If you wish to use TypeScript in your project, please refer to the [TypeScript React template](../TypeScript%20React/README.md)

## Prerequisites
Please refer to the [main README](/README.md#prerequisites) to see what software is necessary to run this project.

## Get started

To start developing:  
  1. Open a terminal session in the folder
  2. Run `npm install`, to install the dependencies

If you encounter any error during the installation process connected to the `@tecnojest/widget-base` package, you may need to build the `lib` yourself. See [building the lib yourself](/README.md#building-the-lib-yourself) for the guide on how to do it.

When everything is complete, you are ready to develop!
