# Templates

## Introduction
In this directory you can find the templates for basic widgets.

## Contribute
To create new templates, please follow the [lib's README](../lib/README.md#index-file) and make sure that the basic methods of the API are implemented.  
If you also have to modify the <strong>lib</strong> for the new implementation to work, try following the [Contribute](../lib/README.md#contribute) section and link the packages.

## Troubleshoot
If you find any error in the templates, please submit an issue specifying the details.
