Software engineering is one of the most dynamic fields of techniques, constantly undergoing changes. 
One of the driver of such a mutable ecosystem, is the wide adoption of open-source software artifacts as fundament of most of software projects out there. This is even more so in the branch of web software engineering, where the pace at which innovations happens is astonishing high.

For the past decades, the web is undergoing transitions under so many aspect, but a clear pattern can be seen here too: the trend towards distributed systems and open architectures.

Our philosophy at [energenious](https://eo.energy) is to embrace decentralization and modularity at all layer of digitalization of the new energy future, from system to web-design.

This series of articles will illustrate the design practice adopted - and freely distributed - by energenious' team to create modular UI for web-based applications, named "Widget-driven design" (or WDD in short).

WDD aims to increase productivity in the agile development of web-applications for small- to medium-sized teams, by promoting code re-usability, loose coupling, and technology agnostic programming of web UI.

## Context and motivation ##

IoT, EIS, --> Dashboard common elements --> "Yet another dashboard"

Innovation slows down due to the need of rewrite the scaffold all over again.

--> engineers become front-end development agency 
--> new features mean changing and redeploying the whole source code 

Tools such as Grafana are very user-friendly and useful for fast prototyping, but suffers from low levels of customization when prototypes need transitioning to actual products, especially in applications which are non dashboard-centric.

## Project's scope ##

The upcoming series of tutorials addresses experienced front-end developers, software architecture engineers, and all of those who are interested in embracing new design practices for agile software development.

The material covered in the tutorials will be made available under energenious' [open-source archive](https://gitlab.com/energenious/widgets) and free for usage and contribution.

Please contact [opensource@energenious.eu](mailto:opensource@energenious.eu) for more specific questions, or support for integration, training, etc.
